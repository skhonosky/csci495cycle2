        <p class="abt-bodyp1">My name is Savanah Honosky, and I am a 20 year old Information Systems major with a passion for cooking. I grew up in a family that was always cooking or baking, so as a result I found my own passion for it as well.</p>
        <p class="abt-bodyp2">I made this website with the hopes of bringing people with these similar interests together so that we can share recipes with one another.</p>
