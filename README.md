a. Description / Purpose - This website is essentially a community cookbook. Anyone can make an account and add a recipe to the cookbook, as well as make suggestions on other recipes in the cookbook. The purpose of this website is to allow members of various communities to share recipes with one another.

b. Dependencies - PHPStorm (for the coding aspect), Access to CCUResearch Database

c. Usage - This website allows users to create an account, login to the account, log out of the account, and view, add, and update recipes.

d. Future Work - In the next cycle, I plan on fully implementing the database functionality into the website. Then, I plan on adding functionality to the recipe part of the website, this includes adding, updating, and modifying recipes. Alongside this, I will also make the corresponding pages for this with user-friendly formatting. From here, I plan on possibly implementing a forum like area where people can give suggestions and advice to one another.

e. What is your major and how this project is related to your major. - I am double majoring in Information Systems and Nursing, so this project would fall entirely into the Information Systems sector of my majors. I am getting to work with implementing a database into a website, and I am also building a website using PHP and HTML, so I am working with those programming skills.
